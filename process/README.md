## Backstory
The main character of Ghost Light, who the player controls, is an old samurai that has fallen in battle and is on a journey to the afterlife. He lived quite a long life, and experienced many battles watching his friends die each and every time. Because he's outlived everybody that fought by his side in his very first battle, he feels like he has failed each and every one of them, and so throughout his journey to the afterlife, he becomes consumed by guilt, and has to face his mental ghosts of the past and everybody who he thinks he's failed. Being so old, and having been injured while dying in battle, he moves slowly, and can't actually outrun any of the ghosts.

## Initial Brainstorming

Ghost Light is a game about a lone samurai exploring the ruins of an ancient temple. Evil spirits haunt the grounds and the samurai can only defeat them using reflected light, rendering his once trusty sword useless against these spectral foes. The original concept was more combat oriented, and involved fighting other samurai within a mirror maze, but for this game, we felt it would be more engaging to implement puzzles revolving around the use of mirrors and light rays to uncover secrets and pathways hidden throughout the temple (the core mechanic). We also want the game's overall aesthetic to reflect the architectural and mythological tropes of Shinto temples.
