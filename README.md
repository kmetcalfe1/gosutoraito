**Initial Brainstorming:**
Ghost Light is a game about a lone samurai exploring the ruins of an ancient temple. Evil spirits haunt the grounds and the samurai can only defeat them using reflected light, rendering his once trusty sword useless against these spectral foes. The original concept was more combat oriented, and involved fighting other samurai within a mirror maze, but for this game, we felt it would be more engaging to implement puzzles revolving around the use of mirrors and light rays to uncover secrets and pathways hidden throughout the temple (the core mechanic). We also want the game's overall aesthetic to reflect the architectural and mythological tropes of Shinto temples.

**Game Summary:**

The game is made up of three levels: the first, where you use a mirror shard to reflect light from a hole in the wall and get that light to hit a certain point in the room. The second, where you aim the light at floating ghosts to scare them away. The third level involves a foggy room with massive mirrors (almost a mirror maze). You must navigate through the room to reach the end, avoiding ghosts or using light to shoo them away. 

The first level has two mechanics- reflecting light with a held old/broken sword, and moving mirror fragments on pedistals. By using these two mechanics, the player can reflect light through the room. The second has one main mechanic- using the sword to reflect light onto ghosts from many points in the room. The third combines these mechanics in an even scarier environment, in which the user must navigate a maze of these large, movable mirrors and use light to avoid/remove ghosts to reach the end. What's at the end is a surprise...
